\title{Transcribe audio or video file using ElevenLabs API}
\usage{
elevenlabs_transcribe(
  file,
  model_id = "scribe_v1",
  language_code = NULL,
  diarize = FALSE,
  num_speakers = NULL,
  timestamps_granularity = "word",
  delete_after = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Character string. Path to the audio or video file to transcribe.}

\item{model_id}{Character string. Model to use for transcription.
Default is "scribe_v1" (most accurate, supports 99 languages).
Alternative: "scribe_v1_experimental" (may be better for multi-language audio).}

\item{language_code}{Character string or NULL. Language code for transcription
(e.g., "en", "es", "fr"). If NULL, language is auto-detected.}

\item{diarize}{Logical. If TRUE, identifies different speakers in the audio.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{num_speakers}{Integer or NULL. Expected number of speakers for diarization.
Only used when diarize = TRUE and total number of speakers is known.}

\item{timestamps_granularity}{Character string. Level of timestamp detail:
"word" (default), "character", or "none".}

\item{delete_after}{Logical. If TRUE (default), automatically deletes the
transcript from ElevenLabs after successful download.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress messages. Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the API (e.g., temperature, seed).}
}
\value{
A list containing the transcription results:
  \item{text}{Full transcript as plain text}
  \item{words}{Data frame with word-level details (text, timing, speaker)}
  \item{language_code}{Detected or specified language}
  \item{language_probability}{Confidence in language detection}
  \item{transcription_id}{Unique ID for this transcript}
  \item{model_id}{Model used for transcription}
}
\description{
Upload an audio or video file to ElevenLabs for speech-to-text transcription.
Returns data frame with individual words, can be transformed into .txt or .srt
}
\details{
The function uses synchronous processing by default, which works for files
of any size. The API has a 10-minute timeout for uploads and processing.

Asynchronous mode (async=TRUE) is available for advanced users who have
configured webhooks in their ElevenLabs workspace, but is not required.

After successful transcription, the transcript is automatically deleted
from ElevenLabs servers unless delete_after=FALSE.

\dontrun{
# Simple transcription
transcript <- elevenlabs_transcribe("interview.mp3")

# With speaker diarization
transcript <- elevenlabs_transcribe(
  file = "meeting.mp4",

  num_speakers = 3
)
