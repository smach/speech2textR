00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,440
[Speaker A] Welcome, everyone, to this second E round

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,240
[Speaker A] profile. I'm Riccardo Rossi and I'm here,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,200
[Speaker A] as usual, with Federico Marini. Hi,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,760
[Speaker A] Federico, how are you? And today our guest

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,400
[Speaker A] is Sharon Machlis. Hi, Sharon, how are

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,680
[Speaker A] you?

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,360
[Speaker B] Hi. Nice to see you.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,560
[Speaker A] Okay. Sharon is director of Editorial Data

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,350
[Speaker A] and Analytics at IDG Communication, and

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,950
[Speaker A] she's also author of Practical R for Mass

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,790
[Speaker A] Communication and Journalism. Did I say it

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,630
[Speaker A] right, Sharon?

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,990
[Speaker B] Yes, you did. Thank you.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,990
[Speaker A] Okay, great. Great to have you here

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,590
[Speaker A] chatting with us. And she's also, of

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,990
[Speaker A] course, one of the ERA 2020 keynote

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,910
[Speaker A] speakers for the virtual conference in

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,270
[Speaker A] June. So my first question is, does

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,410
[Speaker A] journalism need to be data? Journalism

20
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,250
[Speaker A] needs to be data driven today. Or let's

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,930
[Speaker A] say at least to what extent and what role

22
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,050
[Speaker A] for R in this?

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,730
[Speaker B] Yeah, some does and some doesn't. You

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,969
[Speaker B] know, every story doesn't need to have

25
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,890
[Speaker B] data, but a lot of stories need to have

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,530
[Speaker B] data. And good data. Journalists

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,930
[Speaker B] understand that the data isn't the whole

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,690
[Speaker B] story. You still want to talk to people

29
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,570
[Speaker B] and get context and get what we call color

30
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,170
[Speaker B] and, you know, quotes from people.

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,570
[Speaker B] Understanding how the data affects people.

32
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,770
[Speaker B] That's the difference between journalism

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,330
[Speaker B] and just data analysis. But there is an

34
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,330
[Speaker B] awful lot of journalism where having the

35
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,770
[Speaker B] data really makes your story stronger.
