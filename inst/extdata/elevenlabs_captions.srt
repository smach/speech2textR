1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,919
[speaker_0] Welcome, everyone, uh, to this, uh, second

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[speaker_0] IRAM profile. I'm Ricardo Rossi and I'm

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,159
[speaker_0] here as usual with Federico Marini. Hi,

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,079
[speaker_0] Federico.

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:10,619
[speaker_1] Hi.

6
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:15,219
[speaker_0] And today, uh, our guest is Sharon

7
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,739
[speaker_0] Machlis. Hi, Sharon. How are you?

8
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:19,699
[speaker_2] Hi, nice to see you.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,579
[speaker_0] Okay. Sharon, uh, is a- is director of

10
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:26,779
[speaker_0] editorial data and analytics at IDG

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,219
[speaker_0] Communication, and she's also author of

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,819
[speaker_0] Practical R for Mass Communication and

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,500
[speaker_0] Journalisms. Did I say it right, Sharon?

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,979
[speaker_2] Yes, you did. Thank you.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,959
[speaker_0] Okay, great. Great to have you here

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:42,479
[speaker_0] chatting with us. And she's also, of

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,840
[speaker_0] course, one of the IRAM 2020 keynote

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,819
[speaker_0] speakers for the virtual conference in

19
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,279
[speaker_0] June. So my first question is, does

20
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,560
[speaker_0] journalisms need to be... data journalisms

21
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:58,220
[speaker_0] needs to be data-driven today, or let's

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,700
[speaker_0] say, at least to what extent? And what

23
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:04,180
[speaker_0] role for R in this?

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,680
[speaker_2] Yeah, some does and some doesn't. You

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,000
[speaker_2] know, every story doesn't need to have

26
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,900
[speaker_2] data, but a lot of stories need to have

27
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,339
[speaker_2] data. And good data journalists understand

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,459
[speaker_2] that the data isn't the whole story. You

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,819
[speaker_2] still wanna talk to people and get context

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,299
[speaker_2] and get what we call color, you know,

31
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,279
[speaker_2] quotes from people, understanding how the

32
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,720
[speaker_2] data affects people. That's the difference

33
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:28,739
[speaker_2] between journalism and just data analysis.

34
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,559
[speaker_2] But there's an awful lot of journalism

35
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,679
[speaker_2] where having the data really makes your

36
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,079
[speaker_2] story stronger.
